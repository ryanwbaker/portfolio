    <p>This project was definitely the highlight of my year at BCIT! It incorporated everything from the entire year into one project, and it gets used all the time.</p>
    <p>The power supply of the final product was designed by one of the instructors, but as students, we completed every step along the way. A few of the technical components involved in this process were:
        <ul>
            <li>Calculating ideal component values.</li>
            <li>Designing the enclosure in Autodesk AutoCAD.</li>
            <li>Researching available materials and building a Bill of Materials on Digikey.</li>
            <li>Designing the circuitboard in Altium Designer.</li>
            <li>Assembling all the components, including soldering everything onto the circuitboard that was developed in Altium Designer.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-archive" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>My Biggest Takeaways</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designing power for so many options (constant 5V, -12V, and variable from 0-12V) requires additional complexities to be considered (when comparing to designing for just one option by itself).</li>
            <li>This made the Altium Designer process particularly difficult, as individual wires could not be crossed (the circuitboard could only have one layer).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
