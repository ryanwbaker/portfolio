    <h5>Ralph Waldo Emerson once said...</h5>
    <p>"In my walks, every man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I learn from him." This is an important quote that helped me stay humble during this part of the class. I think most people with my background (an MBA in strategic planning, and
        years of experience running a business) would take this course and not learn anything about entrepreneurship out of arrogance. I also tried to remember that <i>I paid for this course</i>, so I might as well try to get something out of it. The
        results were that <b>this attitude allowed me to learn a lot!</b> Here are some big takeaways from ENEL 300 and entrepreneurship:</p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Build Empathy Into Your Product</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customers buy <i>solutions</i> to a problem. If a product developer is able to <i>exactly</i> understand that problem, they will be able to design a successful product.</li>
            <li>Every person has bias, and therefore <b>a diverse team is required in order to maximize empathy.</b> A simple example is the use of <a href="https://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/case-studies/crash.html">gendered crash test dummies.</a>                For years, crash test dummies have been modeled solely after men. How much better would a vehicle sell if <i>all </i> people knew it was tested with <i>them</i> in mind? Engineering problems are generally complex, and require many perspectives
                in order to produce the objectively <i>best</i> solution. Without the diversity, your product will end up excluding potential customers when it doesn't need to. It just makes sense: if your product caters to a larger base of people, it
                has a higher likelihood of becoming successful.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-archive" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Look For Intellectual Property Opportunities</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patent searches can inspire creativity. By seeing what other innovations are happening in the world, I found that I was better able to think "outside the box", just by reading about new patent applications.</li>
            <li>If your product is already being developed by someone else who has intellectual property rights, it will be a constant challenge to circumnavigate the legal issues surrounding this. A lot of hassle can be saved if you find out what intellectual
                property rights exist around your idea before you heavily invest.</li>
            <li>Searching for patents is really easy. <a href="http://patents.google.com">Google Patents</a> and <a href="https://www.wipo.int/patents/en/">WIPO</a> are two free, easy to use websites to search for patents. It takes only minutes to do some
                good patent research!</li>

        </ul>

    <h5><i class="fa fa-recycle" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Products of the Future Are Sustainable</b></h5>
    <div class="w3-container" style="padding: 0px 40px;">
        <p><a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/do-younger-generations-care-more-about-global-warming/">Accoring to Yale University,</a> younger generations are more concerned about climate change than their elderly counterparts.
            <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement">The Paris Agreement</a> is also increasing in regulation, and as a result, countries like New Zealand are <a href="https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2019-06/climate-change-background-paper-patricia-wright.pdf">making financial regulators responsible</a>            for demonstrating how their investments impact climate change. It's not hard to foresee that successful products of the future will <i>have to</i> be sustainable, whether it is due to demand or legally. Here were some strategies discussed
            in ENEL 300 about how to make products that are sustainable:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Build modularly</b>. This encourages reuse of components and easier repair. If a device is not modular and becomes damaged, the entire device must be disposed of. Conversely, if a modular device becomes unusable, <i>only the damaged module</i>                    needs to be repaired.</li>
                <li><b>Use emotions</b> to develop attachment to a product. The example used in class was with Rolexes. Rolexes are considered "timeless", and they never decrease in value. Products that are able to convey "timelessness" or are able to create
                    emotional attachment can make consumers less prone to "just buy another one" as soon as there is a minor defect or problem.</li>
                <li><b>Design for non-destructive assembly/disassembly</b>. If the product can be assembled/disassembled many times without becoming damaged, it will be more easily repaired. Stay away from permanent joints such as glue and welding, and opt
                    for reusable designs (such as bolts).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
