    <p>One of the most practical of the "weekly reflections" in the ILS program was the learning strategies reflection. I found the three strategies discussed to be extremely useful. Here's what they are and how they helped me:</p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Brain Dump of Thoughts</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The basic idea of a brain dump is that you right down everything you know right away. You are essentially "dumping" your thoughts onto paper.</li>
            <li>This learning strategy helped me particularly with exams (and studying for exams). I've found that my brain gets "momentum". Once I start writing a few things down, I'm better able to recall related topics and ideas.</li>
            <li>Seeing a list visually helps with problem solving. For example, in a math type problem, variables are often given in a paragraph of text. One of the first things I like to do in these types of problems is "dump" the things that are given from
                the problem onto paper, then "dump" what related concepts are known, then finally ask what is wanted from the problem.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-coffee" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Creative Recharge Break</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>This strategy has to do with our capacity to focus. Staying focused on a task for too long sometimes leads to inefficiencies.</li>
            <li>I've found this strategy to be particularly useful for longer projects or problems I'm struggling with. In an exam, this means I might skip a tough question and come back to it. In a homework assignment, I might take a full mental break and
                then return to the problem (like going for a walk, getting coffee, etc).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-refresh" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Reframe Stress</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>This strategy can be best summarized by Winston Churchill, who once said "A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every hurdle."</li>
            <li>Sometimes just thinking about stress in a different way can bring relief.</li>
            <li>I often use this strategy when I find myself obsessing about minute details or deadlines. I think to myself about why I love engineering, and why I'm doing what I'm doing. More often than not, I find that this makes me excited to finish the
                project I'm working on or to not sweat the small stuff.</li>
            <li>This strategy helps with procrastination as well. For particularly large projects, getting started is sometimes daunting. Reframing the situation and thinking about "how great it will be to show off" the project to others or to get it done,
                this is sometimes just enough to make me get started!</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
