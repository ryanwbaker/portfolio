    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Agile Project Management process was one of the best takeaways from the ENEL 300 course I took in my second year of engineering school.</li>
            <li>Agile is different than traditional project management methods (which are often <i>incremental</i> instead of <i>iterative</i>).</li>
            <li>Agile Project Management is an <i>iterative</i> project management process that focuses on <i>value creation</i> (ie. a usable product with each <i>iteration</i>).</li>

            </div>
            <li>Notice in the above diagram that the iterative process produces a <b>usable product with every step</b>, which is a key reason why Agile project management is becoming so popular.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>What is Scrum?</b></h5>
    <p>
        Scrum is simply a version of Agile project management. Just like rugby teams meet in scrums throughout a game, Agile Developement Teams meet frequently thoughout the development process, which allow them to be more flexible and adaptable when compared
        to traditional project management teams.

    <h5><i class="fa fa-key" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Key Agile Scrum Terminology</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>User Story: </b>A feature of the product, as stated from the user's perspective. User Stories are usually defined in the following format: "As a <i>(persona)</i>, I want <i>(feature/feature outcome)</i>, so that <i>(goal to achieve)</i>.</li>
            <li><b>Product Backlog: </b> A compiled list of User Stories that are not yet implemented.</li>
            <li><b>Story Point: </b>A single unit used for estimating the difficulty of a user story. The more story points a user story has, the more difficult it is to implement. This is useful for <i>Sprint Planning. </i>Story points are <i>not</i> units
                of time. </li>
            <li><b>Sprint: </b>A period of 3-4 weeks where the Development Team implements one or several user stories. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-users" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Agile Scrum Roles</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Developement Team: </b>The group of individuals who work on physically completing User Stories (by building product features, for example).</li>
            <li><b>Scrum Master: </b> The leader and key support person of the Development Team. This person is likely the most experienced with Agile Scrum project management, and also serves as an interface between the Development Team and the Product Owner.</li>
            <li><b>Product Owner: </b> The interface between the organization and the customer. Product Owners primarily write User Stories, keep the Product Backlog up to date, and keep the client updated with the Development Team's progress.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-birthday-cake" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Agile Scrum Ceremonies</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Daily Standup: </b> This can be thought of as the lifeblood of the Agile Scrum process. Development Teams meet every day to discuss progress and tasks. This synchronizes the team, and allows them to provide support where necessary. Daily
                Standups often involve some kind of visual progress board, like the "Kanban" one depicted below.</li>

            </div>
            <li><b>Sprint Planning: </b> A meeting where the Developement Team plans future sprints. User Stories are given Story Points based on difficulty, some of which may be selected for the upcoming Sprint (based on value created, available resources,
                etc.). Due to the exponential complexity that arises out of difficult User Stories, it is recommended to use Fibonacci numbers when evaluating User Stories for Story Points.</li>
            <li><b>Sprint Review & Testing: </b> The leader and key support person of the Development Team. This person is likely the most experienced with Agile Scrum project management, and also serves as an interface between the Development Team and the
                Product Owner.</li>
            <li><b>Sprint Retrospective: </b> The interface between the organization and the customer. Product Owners primarily write User Stories, keep the Product Backlog up to date, and keep the client updated with the Development Team's progress</li>
        </ul>

    <h5><i class="fa fa-check-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>My Experience and Takeaways With Agile Scrum Project Management</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>This process works extremely well for environments with rapid change, because each iteration provides opportunity to pivot.</li>
            <li>I can't think of a better process or method for startups, because you have a potential "product" for customers very rapidly. This will get products to markets (and therefore revenues) faster than traditional project management.</li>
            <li>Constant retrospection made my team mesh together much faster when compared to working with other teams.</li>
        </ul>
