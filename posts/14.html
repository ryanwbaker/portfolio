    <p>This was a simple "profile card" that I built with React using create-react-app, webpack, and babel while I was
        taking Jonas Schmedtmann's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/"
            target="_blank">Ultimate React
            Course</a>. So far, I've just learned about components, props, and styling within React. Since it's just
        a single page, find the entire
        card embedded below. My favourite part of this project was conditionally rendering the skill level with an emoji
        using props. An array of objects was made with all the data, and one of the fields was 'level'. If the level was
        "beginner", the 👶 emoji was selected; if "intermediate", the 👍 emoji, and "advanced" has the 💪 emoji. This
        was very easy with props!</p>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>React is an incredibly efficient and organized way of building webpages compared to managing separate HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript files.
        </li>
        <li>The component-based architecture of React allows webpages to be broken down into small pieces that can be
            used over and over again.</li>
        <li>Props are how data can be passed into React components. This is just the 'tip of the iceberg', but I'm very
            excited to continue learning React!</li>
        <li>I found <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/deploying-react-apps-github-pages/" target="_blank">a great
                guide</a> on how
            to publish a React app to GitHub Pages, which is what allowed me to quickly push this out to the web.
