        As part of ENEL 300, we were required to develop a "study plan" that we could commit to for the entire semester. As somewhat of a "veteran" student, I've had a planning system that I've been using for many years now. I think each person should develop
        and/or find a system that works best for them. We all have things we're good and bad at, so it makes sense that you should develop a system that caters to you. Here is how I developed the system that works for me:
    </p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Always Be Looking Ahead</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whatever system you come up with, it should be looking ahead regularly. If you don't look ahead often, you're going to miss upcoming events.</li>
            <li>If you're anti-schedule, this is the <i>one thing</i> you really should schedule every week. I say "week", because this is really the minimum you should be looking ahead. How often do surprises come up? Deadlines change all the time.</li>
            <li>In my study plan, I take Sunday afternoons to look ahead at my week. I enjoy this time, as it helps me mentally prepare for what I'm going to accomplish in the coming days and weeks.</li>
            <li>Each time I look ahead, I don't just look at the next week. I try to look ahead at least one month. This allows me to get a jump on tasks that aren't due for awhile, should I find the extra time.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-hdd-o" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Your System Should Be Accessible When You Need It</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>This one seems self-explanatory, but too many times I've had systems where I wrote them down on paper that I didn't keep track of.</li>
            <li>A digital system may help you with this, but I still prefer paper for writing down my tasks. The act of writing them down seems to help me remember, and it's also way more satisfying to physically cross an item off of a list.</li>
            <li>I've found that having a physical planner that I carry with me gives me a spot to always write stuff down when I need it. I know this is maybe a bit "oldschool", but it seems to work for me.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <div class="w3-container blog-img-md" style="text-align: center; ">
        <p>This is an example of the planner I've used for school:</p>

    <h5><i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Core Elements of My School Planner</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>I enjoy numbering the weeks and counting down the weeks until the semester end. This helps motivate me during a not-so-great semester, but it also helps reminds me about how much time is remaining for certain tasks. I find it easier to think
                in terms of "week numbers" rather than physical dates. It's much easier to say "that's X weeks away" when the weeks are numbered.</li>
            <li>I keep the courses for my semester as categories on the sheet of paper. This helps remind me to review <i>each</i> class regularly. Without having them all in my face, it seems like I forget about classes here and there.</li>
            <li>A due date column. This helps me prioritize tasks.</li>
            <li>A priority column. This allows me to easily decide on what's important and what isn't when the list grows to an overwhelming size.</li>
            <li>A large section available for miscellaneous notes. It always seems like there is more information necessary than just a due date, so I have extra space for notes.</li>
            <li>Basically, I take a fresh sheet of paper each Sunday, look ahead at least a month, and write down every task that is relevant. I think the "one page" size limit also helps to prevent creation of lists that are unachievably long to complete.
                Once the tasks are written down, I prioritize them, and that's it! The entire process takes less than 30 minutes, and it definitely helps me stay efficient.</li>
        </ul>
