    <h5>If you want to study something practical...</h5>
    <p>...study the material in this course. Out of all the courses in the ILS (Integrated Learning Stream) program, in my opinion, ENEL 361 is the most practical.</p>
    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-comments-o" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>How I Would Explain This Course To A First Year Student</h5></b>
    <p>This course is the first class where you learn about electronic devices that aren't resistors or op amps. In my opinion, this is the first course where you learn about <i>useful</i> circuit design. In a nutshell, the course goes very deep into how
        core electronic components like diodes and transistors are made, but then spends most of the time showing you the usefulness, practicality, and limitations of these devices.</p>
    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-archive" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>My Biggest Takeaway</h5></b>
    <p>Semiconductors are amazing! I originally thought of semiconductors as a "Jack of all trades, master of none" type of device when I first read about them (because why should you do something only "semi" good?)...but it is exactly the opposite. Semiconductors
        are the reason for so many innovations and technological advancements! To exemplify this, I like to remember that the transistor was invented in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-lost-history-of-the-transistor"
            target="_blank">the 1950s</a>, but the Nobel prize related to a semiconductor is as late as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/optoelectronics/nobel-prize-puts-blue-leds-in-spotlight" target="_blank">2014 for the discovery of the blue LED.</a></p>
    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-share" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>Applying Knowledge From This Course</h5></b>
    <p>Virtually every single lab from all courses in this semester used electronic devices that were outlined in this course. It's probably easier to think about what applications devices in this course <i>couldn't</i> be used for. A fun exercise that we
        did in this class was to think about "how many transistors are with in a 1 meter radius" of you at any given time. Everyone underestimated the amount.</p>
    <p>Here are just a few of the key applications that were learned in this course:
        <ul>
            <li>Voltage regulators</li>
            <li>Converting A/C electricity to D/C electricity</li>
            <li>Designing a circuit to detect "levels" (eg. think of a set point on a thermostat)</li>
            <li>How a digital camera works</li>
            <li>Building circuits that are sensitive to light (eg. a street light controller circuit)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
