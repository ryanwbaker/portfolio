    <p>This was an incredibly fun project that ended up becoming the capstone project for my degree and then spun into a startup company! The best way to describe the project is a "smart watch for horses" that can monitor horse vitals, transmit the data to a website, and then display the data to users in a presentable format. My role in the project was "Software Lead", where I developed both the back-end and front-end portions of the website.  The website was responsible for storing the user data transmitted through a web API, and also displaying the user data in a web user interface.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>This was my first time using an Arduino Nano and the Arduino programming software. I like it a lot! Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I figured out how to use software debouncing in order to make smooth button presses.</li>
            <li>I think I'm going to look into digital displays, because 7-segment displays are a pain to wire up!</li>
