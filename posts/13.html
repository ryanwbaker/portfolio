    <p>This was an incredibly fun project that ended up becoming the capstone project for my degree and then spun into a startup company! The best way to describe the project is a "smart watch for horses" that can monitor horse vitals, transmit the data to a website, and then display the data to users in a presentable format. My role in the project was "Software Lead", where I developed both the back-end and front-end portions of the website.  The website was responsible for storing the user data transmitted through a web API, and also displaying the user data in a web user interface.</p>
    <p>The project won several awards!</p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Knowing the funadmentals of object-oriented programming helped me to quickly learn the Django framework.</li>
            <li>Test Driven Development was annoying in the beginning (writing a unit test for each function), but after a few months of development it started paying off. Every time something was changed, I could confidently deploy a new iteration quickly by simply running the unit tests. As the application became more and more complicated, this made troubleshooting very prescriptive and easy to find code errors.</li>
            <li>Software development is a team effort. Though I did manage to do most of the coding myself, it still took a lot of research and input from the rest of the team. I'm looking forward to what Equusense becomes in the future!</li>
        </ul>
