    <h5>A Famous Quote By <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REWeBzGuzCc" target="_blank">Donald Rumsfeld...</a></h5>
    <p>...goes like this (paraphrased): "There are things we <i>know</i> that we <i>know</i>. Then there are things we <i>know</i> that we <i>don't know</i>. Then there are things that we <i>don't know</i> that we <i>don't know</i>...". ENEL 327 was certainly
        in that final category. More than any other course that I can remember, this course covered a lot of concepts that I never really thought about before. Before studying signals and transforms, I've never <i>really</i> thought about why I was learning
        certain things in mathematics (like Laplace and Fourier transforms). ENEL 327 has definitely made those concepts clearer.</p>
    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-comments-o" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>How I Would Explain This Course To A First Year Student</h5></b>
    <p>To elaborate on my previous statement, I would explain this course to a first year student by saying "everything you learn in math in the first three semesters leads to this class". Though lots of the math still felt very conceptual throughout the
        course, by the end of the course I began to see where applications of signal processing could come into play. There were worksheets throughout the course that helped to touch on future applications of signal processing that we (as electrical engineering
        students) will encounter in the future.</p>
    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-archive" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>My Biggest Takeaway</h5></b>
    <p>There is a common core of mathematics in signal processing that has a wide diversity of applications. Anything from image processing, to communication transmission, to audio processing <i>all involve the same mathemetical principles.</i> This is pretty
        amazing if you think about it. I'm excited to delve into the applications of signal processing in future courses!</p>

    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-share" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>Applying Knowledge From This Course</h5></b>
    <p>Though this course was mostly conceptual, I can tell it lays the groundwork for many practical applications into the future. The ENEL 300 project did use some principles of ENEL 327 already though: namely filter design (which we also learned about
        in ENEL 343 [Circuits II]). For more information on the ENEL 300 project, see portfolio posts titled 'ENEL 300:...'.</p>
