    <h5>A Famous Quote By <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REWeBzGuzCc" target="_blank">Donald Rumsfeld...</a></h5>
    <p>...goes like this (paraphrased): "There are things we <i>know</i> that we <i>know</i>. Then there are things we <i>know</i> that we <i>don't know</i>. Then there are things that we <i>don't know</i> that we <i>don't know</i>...". ENEL 327 was certainly
        in that final category. More than any other course that I can remember, this course covered a lot of concepts that I never really thought about before. Before studying signals and transforms, I've never <i>really</i> thought about why I was learning
        certain things in mathematics (like Laplace and Fourier transforms). ENEL 327 has definitely made those concepts clearer.</p>
    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-comments-o" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>How I Would Explain This Course To A First Year Student</h5></b>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Everything you learn in math in the first three semesters leads to this class</li>
            <li>Throughout the course, everything will feel very conceptual. By the end of the course, however, you will be able to see the practical applications of signal processing, and how important they are.</li>
            <li>There are worksheets throughout the course that will help to touch on future applications of signal processing that we (as electrical engineering students) will encounter in the future</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-archive" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>My Biggest Takeaway</h5></b>
    <p>There is a common core of mathematics in signal processing that has a wide diversity of applications. Anything from image processing, to communication transmission, to audio processing <i>all involve the same mathemetical principles.</i> This is pretty
        amazing if you think about it. I'm excited to delve into the applications of signal processing in future courses!</p>
    <p></p>
    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-share" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>Applying Knowledge From This Course</h5></b>
    <p>Though this course was mostly conceptual, I can tell it lays the groundwork for many practical applications into the future, such as filter design (which was also taught in ENEL 343 [Circuits II]).</p>
