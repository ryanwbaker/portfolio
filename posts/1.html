    <h5>How Do You Have Thanksgiving Without An Oven?<span class="w3-opacity"> October 8, 2018</span></h5>
    <p>On Thanksgiving Day, <i>this</i> happened! What are the chances of having two ovens, and both failing at the same time? Sometimes, life throws things at you that seem impossible, but a little persistence goes a long way. Here's how I managed to get a working oven when both failed on arguably the most essential day to have an oven.</p>
    <ol><b><li>Remain Calm</li></b>
      <p>When I was first notified about this problem, everyone was panicking. It seemed like we were going to be without a turkey on Thanksgiving, and after days of preparation, the general feeling was "all that work was wasted!". The first thing I did was think about "How bad can it <i>really</i> be without a turkey?" I initially assumed that I would not be able to fix the problem, and prepared everyone for the worst. Once the situation was calm, it was easier to think about the problem at hand.
      </p>
    
    <b><li>Get Curious and Ask Questions</li></b>
      <p>One of my favourite problem solving techniques is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">"Five Whys"</a>. It's elegant in its simplicity. It basically states that you will get to the root cause of a problem if you ask "Why" enough times. Though I may not ask "Why" in every problem I encounter, I think it helps to remember that being curious and asking questions is an essential problem solving tool. Initially, I thought "What are the chances that an <i>two</i> ovens would fail at exactly the same time?" It seemed rare, so I first considered external factors (eg. was there a power surge and/or were there breakers flipped?). When I ran out of ideas there, I decided to turn the ovens on and see what happened.</p>
  
    <b><li>Test and Measure</li></b>
      <p>The odd thing about this problem is that <i>the ovens actually got warm.</i> They would get to about 220&#176;F, and stay there, even if the set point was higher (350&#176;F, for example). Even stranger, when the oven was on BAKE mode, it appeared that the BROIL element was on! After a bit of <a href="https://www.automaticwasher.org/cgi-bin/TD/TD-VIEWTHREAD.cgi?56981#:~:text=Generally%2C%20the%20BAKE%20setting%20uses,Hope%20this%20helps.">Googling</a>, I came to the conclusion that the ovens were remaining in preheat mode, but never actually reaching the target temperature. Why would this happen? Maybe one of the elements aren't working?</p><p>To test this hypothesis, I removed the bake element from one of the ovens, connected a voltmeter, turned the oven back on. The findings were that no power was coming to the element! I was getting somewhere.</p>
   
    <b><li>Ask More Questions, and be Persistent</li></b>
      <p>After finding that the bake element wasn't getting any power and running out of ideas to try without trying anything crazy, I called the manufacturer, expecting them to be closed (it was Thanksgiving Monday afterall). I actually got ahold of tech support! Because Canadian and American Thanksgiving holidays occur on different dates, the Americans were working! After explaining the issue, the person on the phone confirmed my suspicions: it was a failing device on the circuitboards of the ovens: the relays responsible for powering the bake elements. The technician said normally they don't offer any more guidance, but because it was Thanksgiving, he decided to help me out. It wasn't without back and forth though. It took some "pumping of tires" and begging and pleading, but he eventually told me that device E6 on the circuitboards are the relays responsible for powering the bake elements. It turns out that <i>they were identical to the relays that power the broil elements.</i> All I would have to do is desolder the (damaged) bake relay from one circuitboard, desolder the (working) broil relay from the other circuitboard, and resolder it onto the first board so there would be two working relays on one board.</p></ol><p>In the end, we managed to have a takeout-free Thanksgiving (albeit, it was a pretty late meal by the time everything was finished). Nevertheless, it was certainly a memorable Thanksgiving, and it helped us remember that we have a lot to be thankful for!</p><div class="container" style="text-align: center;"><div class="w3-container blog-img-sm"><a href="img/thanksgiving_relay.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/thanksgiving_relay.jpg" style="width: 100%;"></a><p class="w3-caption">The problem relay.</p></div></div></p><div class="container" style="text-align: center;"><div class="w3-container blog-img-lg"><a href="img/thanksgiving_circuitboard_banner.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/thanksgiving_circuitboard_banner.jpg" style="width: 100%;"></a><p>Circuit board with the relay removed.</p><p>After Thanksgiving, the rest of the repair was easy.
