    <h5>Large Projects Demand Teamwork!</h5>
    <p>As someone who is more of an introvert, I found this semester really showed me the power of team work. Having a team of people who you can <i>really</i> rely on takes time to develop, but once you get it, it's much better than flying solo. Here are
        some things I learned about teamwork in ENEL 300</p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-handshake-o" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>One Person Can't Do It All and Do It Well</b></h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Delegate tasks.</b> With the workload of the ILS program in general, it would have been impossible to complete everything completely on my own and get good grades. The workload <i>demanded</i> that we work efficiently as a team. This required
                dividing the work up and reviewing outstanding items on a regular basis, but it was still far more efficient than completing everything as one person.</li>
            <li><b>Everyone on your team is better than you at something.</b> The sooner you can figure out what everyone's big skills are, the sooner you will be able to work efficiently as a team. In this particular group project, it turned out that my
                strong suits were leading, coding, and building circuits. My not-so-strong suits were graphic design and video production, but it turned out that my group have members who were <i>fantastic</i> at that!</li>
            <li><b>Leading is an art, not a science.</b> Being the oldest student of the group seemed to put me in a natural leadership position in this group. I was "stuck" as the leader, so I had to make it work. What I found was that learning people's
                nuances really makes a difference. What works for one person, probably won't work for the other. For example, one member of the group produced really good work, but constantly forgot about deadlines. To make this person jive with the rest
                of the group, they just needed some reminders. That's all it took! Another person was what seemed to be a bit of an "overachiever", who put way too much time into certain aspects of the work they were given. What helped this person was
                regularly reviewing their progress. When the rest of the team saw their work and how good it was, they were encouraged to move on (and therefore work more efficiently).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5><i class="fa fa-archive" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i><b>Review What Works and What Doesn't</b></h5>
    <p>Part of the Agile Scrum project management process was a "Retrospective", where we reviewed our work as a team after each Sprint. Some tools we used during this process were:
        <ul>
            <li><b>SWOT Analysis.</b> This stands for "Strengths", "Weaknesses", "Opportunities", and "Threats". During each retrospective, we thought about each of these items as a team and jotted them down into quadrants on a chart, similar to the one shown
                below.

                    <p>A basic SWOT chart.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li><b>Develop A Strategic Plan.</b> This involved thinking critically about each of the components in the SWOT chart, and then using them to produce the best results. How can strengths be used to minimize weaknesses? What opportunities can be
                taken advantage of to minimize threats? etc.</li>
            <li><b>Use the plan you developed!</b> In the first Scrum, we didn't really use the strategic plan we developed, and ended up repeating the same mistakes. To bring this full circle, useful items found in the retrospective <i>should be incorporated into a user story</i>                so that the process becomes "implemented" as part of the regular Scrum process.</li>
        </ul>
