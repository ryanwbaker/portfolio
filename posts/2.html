    <h5>We All Think We Know How a Computer Works...</h5>
    <p>...but now I <i>really</i> know how a computer works. Like most people who have never studied computer architecture, I knew about computer hardware, and I also knew about computer software. In my mind, I imagined these to be two separate entities,
        with "magic" in between that translated the programming in software into the physical operation of the computer hardware. ENCM 369 "Computer Organization" really bridged the gap between hardware and software. Though modern architectures like ARM
        were not explored, this course laid a very good foundation by thoroughly examining a very basic (MIPS) architecture. </p>
    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-comments-o" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>How I Would Explain This Course To A First Year Student</h5></b>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>This course will really give you the "under the hood" knowledge of how a computer actually operates.</li>
            <li>By the end of this course, you will truly appreciate the innovations in computer engineering that make today's most common devices work.</li>
            <li>In a nutshell, you learn the diagram at the top of this post in every intricate detail.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-archive" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>My Biggest Takeaway</h5></b>
    <p>Computers are indeed <i>not</i> magic (though this hasn't changed how fascinated I am about computers). Even though modern architectures are likely exponentially more complex than what was studied in this course, I now have a high level understanding
        about the technology inside a computer.</p>
    <b><h5><i class="fa fa-share" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 20px;"></i>Applying Knowledge From This Course</h5></b>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>As I am writing this on a computer, it's hard not to think about how much this course has changed my perspective of the tool I use the most every day.</li>
            <li>Without this course, the ENEL 300 project have been pretty dull (this was essentially a Year 2 capstone project). Refer to the ENEL 300 portfolio posts if you wish to see the device we built.</li>
            <li> The labs, though notorious for their difficulty, were extremely practical. We learned how to effectively program microcontrollers (PIC architecture), their limitations, and their common applications. This was pretty exciting, as I am not well
                equipped to build practical, low cost electronic devices with enough processing power to build a simple audio device!</li>
            <li>At the time of writing, looking on <a href="https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/filter/embedded-microcontrollers/685?s=N4IgTCBcDaIA4EsDGIC6BfIA">Digikey</a>, the <i>most expensive</i> PIC controller listed is for $47.00 (with the cheapest being
                $0.47). Contrast this with other programmable devices, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or PLDs, the size and cost advantages of learning to use a PIC microcontroller are pretty clear.</li>
        </ul>
