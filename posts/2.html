    <h5>We All Think We Know How a Computer Works...</h5>
    <p>...but now I <i>really</i> know how a computer works. Like most people who have never studied computer architecture, I knew about computer hardware, and I also knew about computer software. In my mind, I imagined these to be two separate entities, with "magic" in between that translated the programming in software into the physical operation of the computer hardware. ENCM 369 "Computer Organization" really bridged the gap between hardware and software. Though modern architectures like ARM were not explored, this course laid a very good foundation by thoroughly examining a very basic (MIPS) architecture. </p>
    <b><h5>My Biggest Takeaway</h5></b>
    <p>Though I found this course very exciting overall, the biggest takeaway I have from this course is that computers are indeed <i>not</i> magic (though this hasn't changed how fascinated I am about computers). Even though modern architectures are likely exponentially more complex than what was studied in this course, I now have a high level understanding about exactly what goes into a computer.</p>
    <b><h5>Applying Knowledge From This Course</h5></b>
    <p> As I am writing this on a computer, it's hard not to think about how much this course has changed my perspective of the tool I use the most every day. Without this course, the ENEL 300 project have been pretty dull. The labs, though notorious for their difficulty, were extremely practical. We learned how to effectively program microcontrollers (PIC architecture), their limitations, and their common applications. This was pretty exciting, as I am not well equipped to build practical, low cost electronic devices with enough processing power to build a simple audio device! Refer to the ENEL 300 portfolio posts if you wish to see the device we built. At the time of writing, looking on <a href="https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/filter/embedded-microcontrollers/685?s=N4IgTCBcDaIA4EsDGIC6BfIA">Digikey</a>, the <i>most expensive</i> PIC controller listed is for $47.00 (with the cheapest being $0.47). Contrast this with other programmable devices, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or PLDs, the size and cost advantages of learning to use a PIC microcontroller are pretty clear.</p>
